| Architecture (CA) is the "What." It's the functional behavior of the computer from the programmer's point of view. It includes the instruction set, addressing modes, and data types. | Organization (CO) is the "How." It's how those architectural features are physically implemented in the hardware. It deals with how components like the CPU, memory, and I/O are connected and work together. |
